# Diversity-Based-Boosting-Algorithm
Implemented diversity based boosting esemble algorithm. Aim of the research was verifying quality of the algorithm from paper of Jafar Alzubi (2016).

Used to esemble: 10 decision trees with constant depth = 3. 
To compare quality of esemble classifiers some standard datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository were used (Breast Cancer, Letter Recognition, Iris, Segment, ionosphere, Statlog (Vehicle Silhouettes), Haberman’s Survival, Contraceptive Method Choice, Isolet, glass, heart-c). 
Because of balanced datasets - standard accuracy and record Win/Draw/Loss used. Statistical confirmation - by test t-Student.

Results (Win/Draw/Loss; stat. significant Win/Draw/Loss):
AdaBoosting: 11/1/10; 5/12/5
Bagging: 17/1/4; 10/10/2
DivBoosting (diversity based boosting): 4/0/18; 2/10/10

Research conducted in June 2022
